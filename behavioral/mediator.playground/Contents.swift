/// # Mediator
///
/// - Description: define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you try their interaction independently.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - it limits subclassing.
///     - it decouples colleagues.
///     - it simplifies object protocols.
///     - it abstracts how objects cooperate.
///     - it centralizes control.
///
/// ## Disadvantages:
///     - Over time a mediator can evolve into a God Object.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - a set of objects communicate in a well-defined but complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are unstructured and difficult to understand.
///     - reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects.
///     - a behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing.
///     - üç≠ Use the Mediator pattern when it‚Äôs hard to change some of the classes because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes.
///     - üç´ Use the pattern when you can‚Äôt reuse a component in a different program because it‚Äôs too dependent on other components.
///     - üç£ Use the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in various contexts.

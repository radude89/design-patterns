/// # Command
///
/// - Description: encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize
/// clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - decouples the object that invokes the operation
///     from the one that knows how to perform it.
///     - it's easy to add new Commands, because you don't have
///     to change existing classes.
///     - you can assemble a set of simple commands into a
///     complex one.
///     - you can implement undo/redo.
///     - you can implement deferred execution of operations.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - parametrize objects by an action to perform.
///     - specify, queue, and execute requests at different times.
///     - support undo.
///     - support logging changes so that they can be reapplied
///     in case of a system crash.
///     - structure a system around high-level operations built on
///     primitives operations.
///     - üç± Use the Command pattern when you want to parametrize
///     objects with operations.
///     - ü•ü Use the Command pattern when you want to queue
///     operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
///     - ü•ó Use the Command pattern when you want to implement
///     reversible operations.

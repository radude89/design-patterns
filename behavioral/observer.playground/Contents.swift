/// # Observer
///
/// - Description: defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its depenendents are notified and updated automatically.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - abstract coupling between Subject and Observer.
///     - support for broadcast communication.
///
/// ## Disadvantages:
///     - unexpected updates - subjects are notified in random order.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.
///     - when a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed.
///     - when an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.
///     - ‚õ≥Ô∏è Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
///     - ü•å Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

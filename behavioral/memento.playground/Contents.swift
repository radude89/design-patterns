/// # Memento
///
/// - Description: without violating encapsulation capture and externalize an
/// object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - preserving encapsulation boundaries.
///     - it simplifies originator.
///
/// ## Disadvantages:
///     - using mementos might be expensive.
///     - hidden costs in caring for mementos.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - a snapshot of (some portion of) an object's state
///     must be saved so that it can be restored to that state later
///     - a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose
///     implementation details and break the object's encapsulation.
///     - üóΩ Use the Memento pattern when you want to produce
///     snapshots of the object‚Äôs state to be able to restore
///     a previous state of the object.
///     - üè∞ Use the pattern when direct access to the object‚Äôs
///     fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.
///

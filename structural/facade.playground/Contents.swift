/// # Facade
///
/// - Description: provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - it shields clients from subsystem components, thereby reducing the number of objects that clients deal with and making the subsystem easier to use.
///     - it promotes weak coupling between the subsystem and its clients.
///     - it doesn't prevent applications from using subsystem classes if they need to.
///
/// ## Disadvantages:
///     - A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
///     - there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
///     - you want to layer your subsystems.
///     - üêõ Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
///     - üêù Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

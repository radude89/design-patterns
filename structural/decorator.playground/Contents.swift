/// # Decorator
///
/// - Description: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - more flexibility than static instance.
///     - avoid feature-laden classes high up in the hierarchy.
///     - a decorator and its component aren't identical.
///     - lots of little objects.
///
/// ## Disadvantages:
///     - it‚Äôs hard to remove a specific wrapper from the wrappers stack.
///     - it‚Äôs hard to implement a decorator in such a way that its behavior doesn‚Äôt depend on the order in the decorators stack.
///     - the initial configuration code of layers might look pretty ugly.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
///     - for responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
///     - when extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing.
///     - üê∫ Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
///     - üêû Use the pattern when it‚Äôs awkward or not possible to extend an object‚Äôs behavior using inheritance.

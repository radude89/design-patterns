/// # Composite
///
/// - Description: compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - defines class hierarchies consisting of primitive objects and composite objects.
///     - makes the client simple.
///     - makes it easier to add new kinds of components.
///
/// ## Disadvantages:
///     - can make your design overly general. The disadvantage of making it easy to add new components is that it makes it harder to restrict the components of a composite. Sometimes you want a composite to have only certain components. With Composite, you can't rely on the type system to enforce those constraints for you. You'll have to use run-time checks instead.
///     - it might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, you‚Äôd need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
///     - you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
///     - üê´ Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
///     - ü¶Ä Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.

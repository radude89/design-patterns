/// # Adapter
///
/// - Description: convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatibile interfaces.
///
/// ## Advantages:
///     - introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the adaptee.
///
/// ## When to use it:
///     - you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
///     - you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.
///     - (object adapter only) you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing ever one. An object adapter can adapt the interface to its parent class.
///     - ðŸŽ³ Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isnâ€™t compatible with the rest of your code.
///     - ðŸŽ° Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that canâ€™t be added to the superclass.
